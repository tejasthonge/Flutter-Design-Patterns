What is Design pattern:

    -


    Types :
        1 Creational
            -its an way of creating the objects
            -mens at the time creating the object we are desided the how the object was created 
            -

        2 Structural 
        3 Behavioral 
    thrier are 23 Design Patterns are present 
    Dry Prinsiple:

1.Factory Method Patterns :
    Define an interface for createing an object but we lat subclass decide which subclass to instantiate  

    - it is an Creational Design pattern 
    - in this patter we are return the the subclass object but at the it depend on which type of paratetor we are passing 
    - by using theat we are abable to create the child class object and 
    - for more knowlage check the exaple
